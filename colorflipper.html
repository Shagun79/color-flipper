        A good work-life balance, said Chris Chancey, career expert and CEO of
        Amplio Recruiting, has numerous positive effects, including less stress,
        a lower risk of burnout and a greater sense of well-being. This not only
        benefits employees but employers, too. “Employers who are committed to
        providing environments that support work-life balance for their
        employees can save on costs, experience fewer cases of absenteeism, and
        enjoy a more loyal and productive workforce,” said Chancey. Employers
        that offer options as telecommuting or flexible work schedules can help
        employees have a better work-life balance. When creating a schedule that
        works for you, think about the best way to achieve balance at work and
        in your personal life. Chancey said that work-life balance is less about
        dividing the hours in your day evenly between work and personal life
        and, instead, is more about having the flexibility to get things done in
        your professional life while still having time and energy to enjoy your
        personal life. There may be some days where you work longer hours so you
        have time later in the week to enjoy other activities.
